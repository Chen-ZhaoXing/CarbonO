##  Our Solution
CarbonO is an application whereby users can claim e-credits when they consume foods with lower carbon footprints. User can browse a page of dishes and compare the carbon emissions of the various dishes through their "carbon rating". Users can upload receipt for a selected dish and upload a receipt for the dish in order to claim "e-credits". When a dish has a higher carbon-rating, users can claim more e-credits for that dish. The receipts are validated using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with the help of the Google Vision API. Lastly, users can convieniently use accumulated e-credits to claim rewards or donate to organizations fighting climate change. 

[NOTE: the uploaded receipts will be validated using using QR code moving forward as the team felt that it prevents loopholes in the system]


## Core Features

***Carbon Footprint Tracker***
> Search from a list of recipes and view their corresponding carbon-emission rating
> Submit a jpeg of receipt for food & claim e-credits (the lower the carbon-emission rating, the more e-credits you can collect!)

***Rewards***
> Users can use e-credits to claim rewards from sustainable brands working towards climate change

***Donation***
> Users can use e-credits to donate to their desired organisation that is fighting climate change
> User can choose to donate to organisations using their credit cards as well

***Dashboard***
> View historical receipt submissions, e-credit wallet and total carbon emissions from food
> Users can easily visualize their carbon emission and summary of data uploaded in the form of pie chart & line graphs
> View historical reward claims and donations made
