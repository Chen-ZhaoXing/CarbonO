##  Our Solution To Climate Change
CarbonO is an application whereby users can claim e-credits when they consume foods with lower carbon footprints. User can browse a page of dishes and compare the carbon emissions of the various dishes through their "carbon rating" (based on Eaternity: https://eaternity.org/). Users can scan QR codes from a receipt for a dish (from the dishes mentioned in our application) and claim "e-credits". When a dish has a higher carbon-rating (dishes with lower carbon footprint) , users can claim more e-credits for that dish. Lastly, users can convieniently use accumulated e-credits to claim rewards or donate to organizations fighting climate change!

## Core Features

***Carbon Footprint Tracker***
> Search from a list of recipes and view their corresponding carbon-emission rating (based on Eaternity)
> Scan QR code on receipt and claim e-credits (the lower the carbon-emission rating of a dish, the more e-credits you can collect!)

***Rewards***
> Users can use e-credits to claim rewards from sustainable brands working towards climate change

***Donation***
> Users can use e-credits to donate to their desired organisation that is fighting climate change
> User can choose to donate to organisations using their credit cards as well

***Dashboard***
> View historical qr scans, totals e-credits, total carbon emissions from food
> Users can easily visualize their carbon emission and summary of data uploaded in the form of pie chart & line graphs
> View historical reward claims and donations made

## Local Deployment
### Cloning The Repository
```base
$ git clone https://github.com/Chen-ZhaoXing/CarbonO.git 
```
### Spring Boot Microservices

**Launching the microservices as individual containers locally **
Change directory to where each microservice spring application is located and run the application file.

**Launching the microservices as individual containers using docker **
Change directory to each microservice folder on any IDE and build the image to docker hub.
Example to build user microservice on intellij, in the terminal type the following:
PS C:/(Your Directory)/CarbonO>cd carbonO/user
Edit the pom.xml file, by replacing the docker file maven plugin configuration with <yourDockerName>/user
PS C:/(Your Directory)/CarbonO/carbonO/user>mvn clean package -D dockerfile.useMavenSettingsForAuth=true dockerfile:push

Now on your on your OS command prompt type the following to run the container:
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --env CARBONO_USERNAME=<STMP_Email> --env CARBONO_PASSWORD=<STMP_password> --name user <yourDockerName>/user:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT 
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name api-gateway <yourDockerName>/api-gateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
docker run -d -p 8761:8761 --name eureka-server <yourDockerName>/eureka-server:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
docker run -d -p 8082:8082 --name carbonTracker <yourDockerName>/carbontracker:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
docker run -d -p 8083:8083 --name userReward <yourDockerName>/userreward:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT


### React Application
```base
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
